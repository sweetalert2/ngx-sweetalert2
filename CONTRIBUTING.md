Before posting a new issue, remember that _ngx-sweetalert2_ is a thin Angular wrapper around [SweetAlert2](https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2), so please be as certain as possible that the problem does not comes from it (this library does not perform any DOM manipulation, nor styling, etc).

However, suggestions are welcome, as well as questions, if these are specific to _ngx-sweetalert2_ (otherwise, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is the best place to get help).
